Follow a step-by-step approach to create a modern, technology-focused website for a research institution using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Use the provided file content to design the website structure and content. Follow these steps:  

1. **Project Initialization**: Create the project framework, including the Next.js setup, Tailwind CSS configuration, and initial file structure for pages and components. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the environment is ready.

2. **Homepage Creation**: Design a homepage that introduces the ALMA Proposal Workshop, including key highlights such as the event title, dates (April 1-3, 2025), and location (KIAA, Peking University). Include a concise overview of the event's purpose, its significance, and a call-to-action linking to the registration page.

3. **Event Details Page**: Create a page with detailed event information:
   - Workshop description (from the document)
   - Key highlights, including the proposal writing and reviewing process, hands-on activities, and topics like interferometry and proposal preparation.
   - Audience information (e.g., targeted towards students and postdoctoral attendees).
   - Include the schedule link and any embedded QR codes.

4. **Organizers Page**: Build a page showcasing the Scientific and Local Organizing Committees. Display their names and roles clearly, as provided in the document.

5. **Registration Page**: Create a registration page with:
   - Registration details, deadlines (February 28, 2025), and the link or QR code.
   - A description of participant selection criteria and registration confirmation timelines.
   - A link to the questionnaire mentioned in the document.

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all pages are fully responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile viewing. Test for consistency across screen sizes.

7. **Testing and Deployment**: Run tests to ensure proper functionality. Deploy the website on a platform like Vercel for public access.

Generate the corresponding Next.js and Tailwind CSS code for each step logically and sequentially, ensuring all components and pages are interconnected. Use the content provided in the document for text, schedules, and links.
